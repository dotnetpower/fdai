"""operator_memory: append-only store for Human Override notes

Revision ID: 20260706_0006
Revises: 20260706_0005

Backs
:class:`~aiopspilot.core.operator_memory.store.OperatorMemoryStore` with a
persistent Postgres table so scope-narrowed operator notes survive
process restarts and can be queried by the composer on every T2 event
(Wave 3 step C-2). The in-memory implementation in
:mod:`aiopspilot.core.operator_memory.store.InMemoryOperatorMemoryStore`
mirrors the schema; this migration only creates the physical backing.

Columns
-------
- ``id`` - UUID primary key, supplied by the caller (the composer keeps
  the same id across the append + supersede lifecycle).
- ``scope_kind`` - ``'resource-group'`` or ``'resource'`` only.
  Anything broader is a rule retirement, not an override, and MUST flow
  through the catalog pipeline; the CHECK constraint enforces this at
  the boundary even if a future Python enum accidentally widens the
  policy.
- ``scope_ref`` - the exact scope reference the composer resolves
  against. Free-form (fork supplies the ARM-id parser); NOT NULL and
  non-empty after trim.
- ``category`` - one of ``preference``, ``override-note``,
  ``forbidden-action``, ``runbook-hint`` - the composer weighs each
  category slightly differently at assembly time. Free-form text is
  rejected so a malicious body cannot bypass the category weighting.
- ``body`` - the note text. Non-empty after trim (defense in depth
  against a bug that skips the Python-side validator).
- ``source_event`` + ``source_ref`` - provenance pair. Wave 3 step B
  initially seeds only ``hil.reject``; later waves extend the
  taxonomy without a schema change.
- ``author`` / ``approved_by`` - the operator who wrote the entry
  and the second, distinct operator who approved it. The CHECK
  constraint refuses self-approval so a caller bypassing the Python
  policy still cannot land an unreviewed entry.
- ``created_at`` - server-side timestamp; TTL evaluation compares to
  this column.
- ``superseded_by`` - self-referential FK; when a later entry
  replaces this one the pointer is threaded here. Append-only means
  the original row is never updated in body or category.
- ``ttl_seconds`` - positive INTEGER or NULL (indefinite lifetime,
  permitted per the Human Override policy).

Indexes
-------
- Primary key on ``id`` (composer's supersede lookup).
- Composite ``(scope_kind, scope_ref)`` index for the "active for
  scope" query that runs on every T2 event.
- Partial index on ``(superseded_by)`` where ``superseded_by IS NULL``
  is intentionally NOT added: the "active" filter already narrows
  through the scope index; a separate partial buys nothing until the
  table exceeds ~10^5 rows.
